# Secret of the universe
"Everything that can be invented, has been invented" - Charles H. Duell - 1899 <br>
I have been the researching the art of meditation and secret ancient knowledge for the past years of my life and how do all the past dots connect to each other. All the things i know points to singularity, the universe of oneness. The journey goes on, so i decide to keep a quick note here. I would like to send my gratitude to the universe for connecting us here  <br>

## Everything is energy
Quantum physics describes the universe as nothing more than vibrating strings of energy [1] <br>
What you focus on, what you put your energy in, with enough intention, will become reality.

## Everything in frequencies

The law of nature that states everything has a vibration. Chemistry classes taught me about atoms, and that everything is made up of atoms. <br>
These atoms are in a constant state of motion, and depending on the speed of these atoms, things are appear as a solid, liquid, or gas. <br>
Sound is also a vibration and so are thoughts. <br>
Everything that manifests itself in your life is there because it matches the vibration from your thoughts. <br>

Thought - Thinks of this like a radio wave, some people will develope their intuition (6th sense) better than others. <br>
Some are better at transmitting, other are better of receiving. So you must be very careful of transmitting and allowing other's thought go inside your head.
You should have a filter system of your own so not allow other thought to intercept your internal universe. <br>

## Everything in vibrations

Vibrations express themselves in corresponding geometrical figures andcrystals are build upon the expression of vibration.  <br>
Crystals collectively form a body of an element according to its particular vibration.  <br>
Crystals, plants, and human beings are music that has taken on visible form.  <br>

## Muladhara Chakra (Root chakra)
Before ascending, you must grounding.  <br>
Your mind, body, and spirit are interconnected. <br>
Work on the root chakra 1st before working on other chakra.  <br>
When the Muladhara Chakra is blocked and imbalanced, it can cause mental stress which is visible through one’s physicality.  <br>
These symtoms, for years of observance, including:  <br>
* Feelings of lethargy or depression
* Feelings of being disconnected and isolated
* Insecure, wories, panic, anxiety, anger 
* Digestive disorders
* Unexplained aches and pains in the body
* Insomnia
* You are always tired

A balance Muladhara Chakra person will have:
* Security
* Stability
* Emotional control
* Self-sufficiency

## Ajna Chakra
Located in the center of the forehead, it acts as the individual’s center of wisdom, conscience, and higher consciousness<br>

When you gain enough exp, you will unlock the 6th sense
* Intuition, vision, and inner wisdom
* Authentic
* Think clearly, see things from multi perspectives and sense their inner guidance. (differ from overthinking)

## Life - Energy - Matter

Everything vibrates. Life is vibration. So is mind. So is matter. 

## Desired Reality Shifting

Use with cautious, one thing you must understand that we are all master of manifester. So when you vibrational frequency change, you leave your comfort zone, your social circle change, expected to lose people and gain new people in life. Those who does not match your frequency will not stay with you. Embrace it.
It also could be your family members
