# Secret of the universe
"Everything that can be invented, has been invented" - Charles H. Duell - 1899 <br>
I have been the researching the art of meditation, sacred geometry and secret ancient knowledge for the past years of my life. I questioned my existence and how to connect all the dots to present. All the things i know points to singularity, the universe of oneness. The journey goes on, so i decide to keep a quick note here. I would like to send my gratitude to the universe for connecting us here  <br>

## Everything is energy
Quantum physics describes the universe as nothing more than vibrating strings of energy [1] <br>
What you focus on, what you put your energy in, with enough intention, will become reality.

## Everything in frequencies

The law of nature that states everything has a vibration. Chemistry classes taught me about atoms, and that everything is made up of atoms. 
These atoms are in a constant state of motion, and depending on the speed of these atoms, things are appear as a solid, liquid, or gas. <br>
Sound is also a vibration and so are thoughts. <br>
Everything that manifests itself in your life is there because it <b> align </b> the vibration from your thoughts. <br>
As soon as you understand it, you are able to manifest / attract everything with your higher-self

Thought - Thinks of this like a radio wave, some people will develope their intuition (6th sense) better than others. <br>
Some are better at transmitting, other are better of receiving. So you must be very careful of transmitting and allowing other's thought go inside your head.
You should have a filter system of your own so not allow other thought to intercept your internal universe. <br>

## Everything in vibrations

Vibrations express themselves in corresponding geometrical figures andcrystals are build upon the expression of vibration.  <br>
Crystals collectively form a body of an element according to its particular vibration.  <br>
Crystals, plants, and human beings are music that has taken on visible form.  <br>

## Muladhara Chakra (Root chakra)
Before ascending, you must grounding.  <br>
Your mind, body, and spirit are interconnected. <br>
Work on the root chakra 1st before working on other chakra.  <br>
When the Muladhara Chakra is blocked and imbalanced, it can cause mental stress which is visible through one’s physicality.  <br>
These symtoms, for years of observance, including:  <br>
* Feelings of lethargy or depression
* Feelings of being disconnected and isolated
* Insecure, wories, panic, anxiety, anger 
* Digestive disorders
* Unexplained aches and pains in the body
* Insomnia
* You are always tired

A balance Muladhara Chakra person will have:
* Security
* Stability
* Emotional control
* Self-sufficiency

## Ajna Chakra
Located in the center of the forehead, it acts as the individual’s center of wisdom, conscience, and higher consciousness<br>

When you gain enough exp, you will unlock the 6th sense
* Positive self-talk (detach negative feelings attached to your self-talks then it's fine.)
* Intuition, vision, and inner wisdom
* Authentic
* Think clearly, see things from multi perspectives and sense their inner guidance. (differ from overthinking)

## Life - Energy - Matter

Everything vibrates. Life is vibration. So is mind. So is matter. 

## Desired Reality Shifting

Use with extreme cautious, one thing you must understand that we are all master manifester. So when your vibrational frequency change, you leave your comfort zone, your social circle change, you expected to lose people and gain new people in life. That's perfectly fine. Without leaving the comfort zone, there is no growth. Those who does not match your vibrational frequency will not stay with you. It also could be your family members. Embrace the discomfort, embrace the changes.

## Old souls
There is a special kind of person in this world who is often misunderstood. These people tend to be the loners, the free spirits, the innocent lovers. They see the world for all they can – and should be – although the world rarely sees them... 
They are the old souls, the dreamers, the people in tune with life, so intuitive of emotions that they frighten us. They frighten us not because of who they are, but because of who we are not, what we lack.
Ancient souls reach depths we cannot understand. They have a connection with God, with the Universe, with nature, and that's why they are the people who will change the world.
We often feel inferior, as if we have to strive to stay remotely close to their level, to be worthy of their love.
It takes a confident person to love an old soul. But it's worth it. It will change your life.
They are romantic, they are loyal, they help us grow, they are not materialistic, they understand the deep connections in life, they are grateful, they are examples of bravery.
They walk the most painful roads of this life, and yet somehow they find the courage to smile. Of being selfless. Support others. Loving an old soul and being loved by it is a gift from the Universe.
